As usual leonard is being mocked by sheldon for being the stupidest person in his house and to prove this sheldon gives leonard a task.He gives leonard a string S. Now leonard is  allowed to choose exactly one substring from S and shift all its characters 1 backward. Example- ‘a’->’z, ‘c’->b , ‘z’->’a’ and so on. Heis allowed to perform this operation only once and have to find out the lexicographically minimum string that can be obtained from s. Can you help Leonard?

### Input
First line contains the number of test cases t. Then t line follows, each containing a string s.
### Output format
For every test Case print the lexicographically minimum string in a separate line.
